# Stationary Text for Watchy

A port of the port of the popular Pebble watchface "Sliding Text". The e-ink screen on Watchy doesn't really do animation, so the text doesn't slide in this version.

I'm likely to drop this project in a couple weeks when I either get bored of it or it starts working on my watch with the current version of the watchy library, fair warning.

the only problem from the old version is there is no settings.h file, so you can steal the one from any of the example watchy faces and it will run, given this face doesn't use any of that data
